  <h3 align="center">Car GST Reduction in India</h3>
  <br>
  <p><b>1. New GST Reform (GST 2.0) Implemented

The Indian government reformed the GST structure for automobiles, effective 22 September 2025, to simplify and reduce taxes on car purchases.

2. Lower GST on Small Cars

Small petrol, LPG, or CNG cars (engine ≤ 1200 cc and length ≤ 4000 mm) and similar diesel cars (engine ≤ 1500 cc) now attract 18% GST, down from around 28% plus additional cess earlier.

3. Flat 40% GST for Larger Cars and SUVs

Mid-size, large cars, SUVs, MPVs, and many utility vehicles now come under 40% GST without the earlier compensation cess. This means overall tax burden has reduced even if the slab seems higher than 28%.

4. Luxury Cars Also Benefit

High-end and luxury cars previously faced GST + cess totalling up to roughly 45–50%. Under the new system, they are taxed at a flat 40% GST, making them cheaper by several lakhs for customers.

5. Removal of Compensation Cess

The compensation cess (which added up to ~22% tax on many vehicles) has been abolished, reducing the overall tax burden and helping lower on-road car prices.

8. Overall Impact on Buyers

Buyers of small and mid-range cars now pay less tax, lowering the ex-showroom and on-road prices.

Larger cars and luxury vehicles also see net savings due to cess removal and new 40% slab.

This reform encourages higher car sales, especially in the festive season.</b></p>
